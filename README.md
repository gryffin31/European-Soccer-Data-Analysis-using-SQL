Data Analysis using SQL for European Soccer Database

# European Soccer Data Analysis using SQL

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the European Soccer Database using SQL and Python. The goal is to practice SQL and Python skills while analyzing the data to gain insights into the European soccer industry.

## Data

The European Soccer Database contains data on soccer matches, teams, players, and more. The data is stored in a SQLite database and can be accessed using SQL queries.

## Project

The project consists of several SQL queries that analyze the data in the database. The queries are designed to answer questions such as:

- Which teams have the most wins?
- Which players have the highest salaries?
- What is the average attendance for each league?

The results of the queries are displayed using Python libraries such as pandas and seaborn.

## Techniques Used

The project uses several techniques to analyze the data, including:

- SQL queries: used to extract data from the database and perform calculations.
- Python libraries: used to visualize and analyze the data, including pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
- Data cleaning: used to remove missing or incorrect data from the database.

## Conclusion

The "European Soccer Data Analysis using SQL" project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be used to gain insights into complex datasets. The project provides a foundation for further analysis and can be used to inform decisions in the European soccer industry.
